# Switching Recurrent Neural Networks

This repo is about the work of Switching Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNNs). Publication available at: [Inference of neural dynamics using switching recurrent neural networks](https://openreview.net/pdf/a72b19b658dbec5e7192f749e9871e5279caf5ab.pdf)

# Installation for Development

# Implementation
1. git clone this repo to your local folder
2. build environment
```
conda env create --file environment_srnn.yml
conda activate SwitchingRNN
```
3. If environment is not built successfully, do 'pip install'+all missed packages, they are common packages in this experiment. 
4. ```python demo_lorenz.py``` (example running) 
5. or open demo_lorenz.ipynb

# Details
1. SRNN: model of SRNN
2. demo_lorenz.ipynb: Demo notebook
